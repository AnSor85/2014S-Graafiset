2014S-Graafiset
===============

This coursework has a main assignment for making a simple Android based game. 
We named our game "Balls the Game".
Because of that, release tags in this repo will be tied to that module, which resides under "ballsthegame" -folder.

There are master and develop branches. Team members, please use the develop only when making changes.
I will merge develop whenever the next working release is ready.
